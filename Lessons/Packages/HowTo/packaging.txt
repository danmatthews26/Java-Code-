•Definition: A package is a grouping of related types providing access protection and name space management.
 Note that types refers to classes, interfaces, enumerations, and annotation types. Enumerations and annotation 
 types are special kinds of classes and interfaces, respectively, so types are often referred to in this lesson
 simply as classes and interfaces.

•package names are lower case to avoid conflict with the names of classes or interfaces.
•used to organize and not have nameing conflictions
•package is like a folder
•order of project:
	project foler
		src folder
			default package
				src files
			other packages
				src files
				
•default package has no declaration
•Companies use their reversed Internet domain name to begin their package names—for example, 
 com.example.mypackage for a package named mypackage created by a programmer at example.com.
•In some cases, the internet domain name may not be a valid package name. 
 This can occur if the domain name contains a hyphen or other special character, 
 if the package name begins with a digit or other character that is illegal to use 
 as the beginning of a Java name, or if the package name contains a reserved Java 
 keyword, such as "int". In this event, the suggested convention is to add 
 an underscore. For example:

 Legalizing Package Names
 Domain Name	Package Name Prefix
 hyphenated-name.example.org	org.example.hyphenated_name
 example.int	int_.example
 123name.example.com	com.example._123name
